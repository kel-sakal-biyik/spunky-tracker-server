# spunky-tracker-server

This GraphQL server has an empty Schema. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create
the schema and its resolvers.

Your Query should return both microphone and GPS outputs.

While your microphone query returns `decibel` value, GPS query will return `latitude` and `longitude`.

**Hint:** You can use casual package to help you returning random values.

`npm i casual -D`
